# bitbucket-issues

A simple BitBucket issue tracker. DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS, STILL NOT SYNCED TO BITBUCKET YET.

## Use

If you select `Packages` -> `BitBucket Issues` -> `Issues`, then Atom
will fetch the issues connected to the current repo's origin repo,
assuming it's on BitBucket. Easy peasy.
