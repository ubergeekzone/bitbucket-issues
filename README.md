# bitbucket-issues

A simple BitBucket issue tracker. Shows you current bitbucket issues that are new/open

## Use

If you select `Packages` -> `BitBucket Issues` -> `Open/New Issues for this repo`, then Atom
will fetch the issues connected to the current repo's origin repo,
assuming it's on BitBucket. Easy peasy.
